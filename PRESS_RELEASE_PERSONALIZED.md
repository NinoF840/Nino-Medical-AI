## Italian Developer Nino Piacenza Launches Revolutionary Medical AI That Achieves 83.3% Accuracy in Italian Healthcare Text Processing

**Nino Medical AI introduces breakthrough multi-source detection technology, becoming the first Italian-specialized medical NER solution with transparent AI methodology**

**ITALY** - *June 16, 2025* - **Nino Piacenza**, an independent Italian AI researcher and developer, today announced the launch of **Nino Medical AI**, a groundbreaking Italian Medical Named Entity Recognition platform that represents a major breakthrough in healthcare artificial intelligence. The system achieves an unprecedented 83.3% recall rate in processing Italian medical text, surpassing existing solutions by over 8 percentage points.

### Revolutionary Multi-Source Detection Technology

Nino Medical AI introduces the world's first **multi-source detection algorithm** specifically designed for Italian medical terminology. This proprietary technology combines deep learning with 37 specialized pattern recognition algorithms and medical dictionary integration, creating a transparent AI system that shows users exactly how each medical entity was detected.

**"This is not just another AI model ‚Äì it's a complete paradigm shift in how we process Italian medical text,"** said **Nino Piacenza**, Founder and Chief AI Officer of Nino Medical AI. **"For the first time, healthcare professionals can see exactly why the AI made each decision, whether it came from our neural network, pattern matching, or medical dictionary. This transparency builds trust and enables better clinical decisions."**
