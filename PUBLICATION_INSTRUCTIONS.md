## üîÑ How to Publish to GitHub/Hugging Face

### Option 1: Hugging Face Hub (Current Repository)

Since your repository is connected to Hugging Face, you need to authenticate:

1. **Get your Hugging Face token**:
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Create a new token with write permissions

2. **Configure git credentials**:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   echo "https://your_username:your_token@huggingface.co" > ~/.git-credentials
   ```

3. **Push the improvements**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Create a New GitHub Repository

If you want to publish to your personal GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `italian-medical-ner-improvements`
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Add GitHub as a remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add github https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/italian-medical-ner-improvements.git
   git push github main
   ```

3. **Authenticate with GitHub**:
   - Use your GitHub username and personal access token
   - Or set up SSH keys

### Option 3: Manual Upload

If git authentication is complex:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload files manually through the web interface
3. Copy the content of key files:
   - `BLOG_POST.md` - Your technical blog post
   - `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete documentation
   - `improved_inference.py` - Enhanced inference code
   - Updated `README.md` - With usage examples
