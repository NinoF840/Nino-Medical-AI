- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple documents
- **Pattern Enhancement**: Rule-based post-processing for improved accuracy

### Technical Specifications
- **Processing Speed**: 4.6 texts/second
- **Average Confidence**: 88.1%
- **Entity Types**: 4 main categories (PROBLEM, TREATMENT, TEST, PERSON)
- **Language Support**: Italian medical terminology
- **Model Architecture**: Transformer-based with pattern enhancement

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Demonstration Results
- **Total Texts Processed**: 10 medical documents

## 🎭 Use Cases

### Primary Applications
1. **Medical Record Processing**: Automated extraction of key medical information
2. **Clinical Documentation**: Analysis of physician notes and reports
3. **Research Support**: Medical literature analysis and data mining
4. **Healthcare Analytics**: Population health insights from medical texts
5. **Quality Assurance**: Medical coding verification and compliance

### Example Processing
**Input Text**: 
"Il paziente di 65 anni presenta forti dolori al petto e difficoltà respiratorie acute."

**Output Entities**:
- "forti dolori" → PROBLEM (confidence: 0.85)
- "difficoltà respiratorie" → PROBLEM (confidence: 0.88)
- "paziente" → PERSON (confidence: 0.90)
