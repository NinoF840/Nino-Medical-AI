### 🔴 **Reddit - r/MachineLearning**

**Title:** [D] Achieved 83.3% recall in Italian Medical NER with multi-source detection - sharing methodology and results

**Content:**
Hi r/MachineLearning! 👋

I wanted to share a breakthrough I've achieved in Italian medical Named Entity Recognition that might interest the community.

**TL;DR:** Developed a multi-source detection system achieving 83.3% recall (+8pp improvement) in Italian medical text processing with transparent source attribution.

**Background:**
Most medical NER systems are English-centric, leaving Italian healthcare underserved. Existing Italian medical NER achieves <70% F1, making clinical adoption challenging.

**Methodology:**
Instead of relying solely on transformer models, I developed a multi-layer approach:

1. **Enhanced BERT Layer:**
   - Fine-tuned on Italian medical texts
   - CRF integration for sequence modeling
   - Focal loss (α=2.0, γ=3.0) for class imbalance

2. **Pattern Recognition Layer:**
   - 37 hand-crafted regex patterns for Italian medical terms
   - Handles compound terms: "mal di testa" (headache)
   - Regional variations: "cefalea" vs "emicrania"

3. **Medical Dictionary Layer:**
   - 20+ common Italian medical terms
   - Confidence scoring integration
   - Fallback detection for edge cases

4. **Smart Merging Layer:**
   - Resolves overlapping detections
   - Confidence-based prioritization
   - Source attribution (model/pattern/dictionary)

**Results:**
- Baseline BERT: 75.3% recall
- Multi-source system: 83.3% recall
- Processing time: <500ms
- Transparency: 100% source attribution

**Key Innovation:**
The transparency aspect is crucial for healthcare adoption. Every detected entity shows its source (neural network, pattern match, or dictionary lookup), building trust with medical professionals.

**Entity Types:**
- PROBLEM: diseases, symptoms, conditions
- TREATMENT: medications, therapies, interventions
- TEST: diagnostic procedures, lab tests

**Demo available:** [link to demo]

Happy to discuss methodology, share insights, or answer technical questions!

**Questions for the community:**
1. Has anyone tried similar multi-source approaches?
2. Thoughts on transparency vs. pure performance trade-offs?
3. Interest in collaborating on other medical languages?

### 🟠 **Hacker News**

**Title:** Show HN: Nino Medical AI - 83.3% accuracy Italian medical NER with transparent multi-source detection

**Content:**
Hi HN! 👋

I've been working on a problem that's been bugging me: most medical AI is English-only, leaving billions of non-English speakers underserved.

So I built Nino Medical AI - the first Italian-specialized medical Named Entity Recognition system with transparent decision-making.

**What makes it different:**

🤖 **Multi-source detection** - instead of just using one model, it combines:
- Enhanced BERT neural network
- 37 Italian medical regex patterns
- Medical dictionary lookup
- Smart merging with confidence scoring

🔬 **Transparency** - shows exactly HOW each medical entity was detected (model/pattern/dictionary). Crucial for healthcare where doctors need to understand AI decisions.

🎯 **Performance** - 83.3% recall (+8pp improvement over baseline), <500ms response time

**The problem I'm solving:**
Italian healthcare processes millions of medical documents, but existing AI:
- Is designed for English
- Achieves <70% accuracy on Italian
- Lacks decision transparency
- Doesn't comply with European healthcare regs

**Tech stack:**
- Python, PyTorch, Transformers
- FastAPI for the REST API
- Custom BERT fine-tuning with CRF
- Regex pattern library for Italian medical terms

**Business model:**
- Professional API (€299/month)
- Enterprise licensing for healthcare companies
- Targeting €2.1B Italian healthcare IT market

**Try the live demo:** [demo link]
**API docs:** [docs link]

This is completely autonomous research - no external funding, no team, just me solving a problem I'm passionate about.

Love to hear your thoughts, especially on:
1. Multi-source vs. single-model approaches
2. Transparency in healthcare AI
3. Monetization strategies for specialized AI

Building in public, happy to answer any questions!
